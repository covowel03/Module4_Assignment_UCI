# Module 4 Assignment
Hello, here is my project for the assignment **4**.

## How does it works ?
_It's very easy._

- First, you have to clone this repository.
- Next, you run **npm run migrate**
- Then, you run **npm run seed**
- After that, you run **npm run start**
- Afterwards, open your website and search **localhost:3000**
- When you use the website, **be aware to use the "Show me the Users" button to refresh the database display ! (When you insert, update or delete a user you have to click this button to display the changes)**
- Moreover, when you delete a user, it only uses the id to recognize him.
